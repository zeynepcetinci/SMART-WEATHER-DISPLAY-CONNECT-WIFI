# SMART-WEATHER-DISPLAY-CONNECT-WIFI
SMART WEATHER DISPLAY (ISTANBUL) CONNECT WIFI

I made this project using NodemCu module.
Hands-on projects can be carried out using the NodemCU wifi connection. 
However, at the moment, I showed the weather information of 'Istanbul' on the LCD screen from the 'https://openweathermap.org' site.

It will be enough to enter the city IDs to learn the weather conditions of the countries of other cities you want.

In order to be able to access the NodemCu module, we write the wifi address and password of the computer you wrote your code to. 
In this way, communication between your computer and NodemCu is ensured.
